## Hi there, I'm Ibrahim ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech enthusiast and lifelong learner currently transitioning from frontend development to the exciting field of cybersecurity.

With 3+ years of experience as a frontend developer, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, creating seamless, user-centric digital experiences. My background in crafting responsive and accessible designs has taught me the importance of both functionality and security in application development.

I'm now pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity, expanding my expertise into areas like:
- Network Security
- Risk Analysis
- Ethical Hacking
